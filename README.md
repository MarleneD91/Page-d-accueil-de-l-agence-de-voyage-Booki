Code for the interface of the web site, using only HTML and CSS.
This project is the 2nd from the formation "Developpeur web" mentored by Openclassrooms.

Based on a design model made with Figma, I had to code the interface using HTML and CSS, from scratch. 
An additional document was given to provide specifies and constraints; for example, a different type type when mouse is hover an element, or the use of flexbox to organize the elements.
This was made in approximately a week.

What skills were evaluated ?
 - To integrate content according to a model with HTML and CSS,
 - To implement a responsive interface using HTML and CSS,
 - To install a front-end web development environment,
 - To version the project with Git and Github.
